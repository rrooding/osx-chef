## Installation under Mavericks (OS X 10.9)

### 1. Install XCode

Don't forget to start up Xcode once it's installed so that you can agree to the terms&mdash;many commands won't work until the terms have been agreed to.

### 2. Install Command Line Tools
  
    xcode-select --install
    
### 3. Run the go script

[You may want to modify your Energy Saver preferences (**System Preferences &rarr; Energy Saver &rarr; Computer Sleep &rarr; 3hrs**) because soloist usually takes 2-3 hours to complete.]
